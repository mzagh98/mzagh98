# 👋 Hi, I’m Mehdi  
### 🧠 Machine Learning Engineer · Data Scientist · Biologist

I explore how **data, models, and code** can turn complexity into clarity.  
From **cell culture experiments** to **deep learning pipelines**, I’ve always been driven by the same goal:  
**understanding systems — and improving them.**

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- 🧩 Building smarter models — from churn prediction to multimodal sentiment analysis  
- 💡 Exploring **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **ethical ML**  
- ☁️ Scaling workflows with **Docker**, **MLflow**, **Airflow**, and **PySpark**  
- 🧬 Bridging **biology**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision**

## 🔬 Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **🩸 Multi-Source Blood Cell Image Classification & Harmonization** | Full pipeline for harmonizing multi-source blood cell data (domain shift correction, safe color normalization, segmentation, resizing, augmentation) and training an optimized XGBoost classifier. Includes Streamlit deployment. | Python, OpenCV, XGBoost, Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas |
| **Customer Churn Prediction** | Built and evaluated ML models (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85) to identify key retention drivers such as contract type, billing, and service duration. | Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Power BI |
| **Instagram Sentiment Analyzer** | Multilingual multimodal sentiment classifier using BERT/RoBERTa + emoji sentiment fusion. | Transformers, PyTorch, NLP, HuggingFace |

## 🎓 Background

Former **biologist** turned **machine learning engineer**.  
Trained at **École des Mines ParisTech (Mines Paris – PSL)** and **Aix-Marseille University**.

I bring the precision of **experimental design** into the data world —  
every model, every metric, every insight should **mean something**.
